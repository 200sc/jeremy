Jeremy the Clam is a game made for the [Gopher Game jam](https://itch.io/jam/gopher-jam), in the last three days of the game jam instead of in the preceding three months.
Jeremy is a simple tile-based puzzle game, but I think it uses some nice code patterns that made coding it really enjoyable.

## Controls

E to pick up.

Space to drop.

Hold R to reset a level if you're stuck.

## Modding?

If you want to try to make your own levels, just look at the csvs in the level folder-- the numbering refers to indices in `tileenum.go`.
